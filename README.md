# Simon Game
In this project i decided to do a normal Simon game. It is a memory game where you have to follow the sequence and copy the sequence correctly to move on to the next level. I decided to have 2 modes in this game, medium and hard. The medium mode is pretty straight forward. When a coloured button flashes, you click on the button. When you get futher on in the game you will have several colours to rememeber in order. The game gets harder the longer you play! As for the hard mode, i decided to make the buttons change positions every time you move on to the next level, i thought this would make it harder for the user to rememeber each colour in order. For the design of the game i decided i wanted to have a big circle as the game board and 6 coloured buttons all around inside the big for the sequence. In this middle of the game board i have put a smaller circle with the control buttons in.
# Features
In this project the buttons flash and the user is to copy the sequence and click the correct button.
You can change the mode from 'medium' to 'hard'.
You can reset the game throughout the game.
I have a counter so the user knows what level they are on throughout the game.
The coloured buttons change positions when you move on the next level in hard mode.
I have used a random function which will allow the game to use a unique sequence each time.
I have used 'start' and 'reset' buttons to let the user have control of the game.
